      5. Initiating a Claim

      for the purchase or sale of a Product on the Site has breached any of the
      Final Terms, including but not limited to those concerning the Grade,
      quantity, location, or delivery, you may submit a claim using merQbiz's
      claim-initiation form available on the Site (a "Claim"). You may submit a
      Claim within three (3) days of delivery of the Product. Any Claim that is
      submitted after such three-day period will be rejected.
    </Paragraph>
    <Heading tag="h3" margin="small" strong>
      6. Claim Procedure
    </Heading>
    <Paragraph margin="small">
      Once you have submitted a Claim, merQbiz will log the claim in its Claim
      system and notify the other party subject to the Claim on the next
      business day (a "Claim Notice"). The recipient of a Claim Notice
      (the&nbsp;"Recipient") will have a period of three (3) business days to
      accept or reject the claim by contacting you using the messaging features
      provided through the Site.&nbsp; If the Recipient does not accept or
      reject the Claim during such three-day period, the Claim will be deemed
      rejected.&nbsp; If a Claim is rejected, either party may request that
      merQbiz arrange a telephone conference between the parties at a mutually
      acceptable time for the purpose of facilitating a resolution.&nbsp; A
      merQbiz representative will be present on the telephone conference, but in
      no event will merQbiz act as arbiter or otherwise participate in
      discussions to resolve the Claim.&nbsp; You acknowledge and agree that
      merQbiz has the right to (i) record any such telephone conferences and
      (ii) suspend or terminate your account, or downgrade your User Rating, if
      you fail to attend a scheduled telephone conference without prior notice
      or otherwise fail to cooperate in good faith.&nbsp;

      7. Resolution of Claim; Remedies
    </Heading>
    <Paragraph margin="small">
      &nbsp; If a Claim is resolved, whether by the Recipient accepting the
      Claim following receipt of the Claim Notice or through participation in
      the telephone conference, both parties are expected to promptly comply
      with the terms of the resolution, including any agreed upon refunds,
      returns or adjustments.&nbsp; If the Recipient does not comply with the
      terms of the resolution, or if your Claim remains unresolved, you may
      pursue all remedies against the Recipient that may be available under
      applicable law.&nbsp; Because merQbiz is not directly involved in a
      Transaction between individual Buyers and Sellers, merQbiz is unable to
      issue refunds, remove defective or damaged Products, or take other steps
      to resolve a Claim.
    </Paragraph>
    <Heading tag="h3" margin="small" strong>
      8. Release of merQbiz
    </Heading>
    <Paragraph margin="small">
      You acknowledge and agree that (a) merQbiz does not take title to or
      possession of any Product being sold on the Site and (b) merQbiz is
      neither a party to any Online Transaction nor your agent or an agent of
      any Seller or Buyer in any Online Transaction. In the event of a dispute
      arising from an Online Transaction, INCLUDING ANY CLAIM, you hereby
      release merQbiz, its directors, officers, employees and agents from and
      against any and all claims, demands and damages (actual, special,
      incidental and consequential, and including attorneys' fees) of every kind
      and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and
      undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such dispute. If
      you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542,
      which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the
      creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of
      executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected
      his settlement with the debtor."
